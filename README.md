This repository is similar to the [GB database](https://github.com/gbdev/database) one, but aims to include **GBA** games.


## Contribute

We want to include every homebrew, game or demo ever produced for Game Boy Advance.

If you know an interesting entry, please [contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md), everyone can add new games or improve the existing entries, it's really easy!

There are also a lot of websites and blogs with a lot of ROMs, we are writing script to automatically scrape those resources. [Take a look](scrapers/README.md).
