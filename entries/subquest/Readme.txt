{SubQuest - The Search for the Virtual Pet}
SubQuest - The Search for the Virtual Pet is an RPG game for the Game Boy Advance. A person named Ethan has lost his Virtual Pet and is searching across the Light Region in order to find it, but as the search goes on he finds out about a different world named the Phantom World. Can he find his Virtual Pet before it's too late? It's not supposed to be a sequel to the original Quest, since it's more like a Quest 1.5.

[ADDITIONAL CREDITS]
One of the minigames that can be played in the game is a "demake" of the first stage of Touhou Fuumaroku (Demon-Sealing Record) ~ the Story of Eastern Wonderland. I say "demake" because GB Studio's limitations made it not that accurate to the original version (please play the original version if you haven't already). Before deciding that this game breaks any rules of the GBA Winter Jam '21, please understand that I tried to follow the official guidelines set in place as much as possible.
